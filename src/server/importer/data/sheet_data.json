        "The American Mafia, commonly referred to in North America as the Italian-American Mafia, the Mafia, or the Mob, is a highly organized Italian-American criminal society and organized crime group.  The organization gradually evolved into a separate entity partially independent of the original Mafia in Sicily, and it eventually encompassed or absorbed other Italian immigrant and Italian-American gangsters and Italian-American crime groups active in the United States and Canada.",
        "In August 1960, Colonel Sheffield Edwards, director of the Office of Security of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), proposed the assassination of Cuban head of state Fidel Castro by Mafia assassins. Between August 1960 and April 1961, the CIA, with the help of the Mafia, pursued a series of plots to poison or shoot Castro.\r\nOn January 20, 2011, the United States Justice Department issued 16 indictments against Northeast American Mafia families resulting in 127 charged defendants and more than 110 arrests. The charges included murder, murder conspiracy, loansharking, arson, robbery, narcotics trafficking, extortion, illegal gambling and labor racketeering. It has been described as the largest operation against the Mafia in U.S. history.\r",

It is a loose association of criminal groups that share a common organisational structure and code of conduct and honor and present themselves to the public under a common brand. ",
        "Politicians court mafiosi to obtain votes during elections. A mafioso's mere endorsement of a certain candidate can be enough for their clients, relatives, and associates to vote for that candidate. Politicians usually repay this support with favours, such as sabotaging police investigations or giving contracts and permits.\r\nMafiosi provide protection and invest capital in smuggling gangs. Smuggling operations require large investments (goods, boats, crews, etc.) but few people would trust their money to criminal gangs. It is mafiosi who raise the necessary money from investors and ensure that all parties act in good faith. They also ensure that the smugglers operate in safety.\r\nMurders are almost always carried out by members. It is very rare for the Mafia to recruit an outsider for a single job, and such people are liable to be eliminated soon afterwards because they become expendable liabilities. Mafia violence is most commonly directed at other Mafia families competing for territory and business.\r\nThe Mafia's power comes from its reputation to commit violence, particularly murder, against virtually anyone. Through reputation, mafiosi deter their enemies and enemies of their clients.\r",

It is considered to be a \"semi-autonomous\" offshoot of the Taliban. It has been most active in eastern Afghanistan and across the border in north-west Pakistan.",

In the latter stages of the war, Haqqani formed close ties with foreign jihadists, including Osama bin Laden, becoming one of his closest mentors. The Haqqani network pledged allegiance to the Taliban in 1995, and has been an increasingly incorporated wing of the group ever since. Taliban and Haqqani leaders have denied the existence of the \"network\", saying it is no different from the Taliban. In 2012, the United States designated the Haqqani network as a terrorist organization. In 2015, Pakistan banned the Haqqani network as part of its National Action Plan. The elusive Haqqani network has been blamed for some of the deadliest attacks during the War in Afghanistan (2001-2021), having a reputation of frequently using suicide bombings and being able to carry out complex attacks. Alongside Al-Qaeda, the Haqqani network maintains close ties with the anti-India Jaish-e-Mohammed, and the Lashkar-e-Taiba. Following the Fall of Kabul (2021), the group was put in charge of domestic security by the Taliban.\r",

        "Many police and international intelligence agencies, including the United States Department of Justice and Europol, consider the club an organized crime syndicate.\r\nVarious U.S. law enforcement agencies classify the Hells Angels as one of the \"big four\" motorcycle gangs, along with the Pagans, Outlaws, and Bandidos, and contend that members carry out widespread violent crime and organized crime, including drug dealing, trafficking in stolen goods, extortion, and prostitution operations. Members of the organization have continuously asserted that they are only a group of motorcycle enthusiasts who have joined to ride motorcycles together, to organize social events such as group road trips, fundraisers, parties, and motorcycle rallies, and that any crimes are the responsibility of the people who carried them out, not the club as a whole.\r\nIn May 2019, a court in Utrecht issued a verdict that made the Netherlands the first country to completely ban the Hells Angels. The presiding judge called it \"a danger to public order and the rule of law\". Other countries such as Germany had banned local chapters, but never the entire club. On July 15, 2022 the Supreme Court of the Netherlands reaffirmed the ban, making it permanent.\r",

In the post-2001 war in Afghanistan, HIG \"reemerged as an aggressive militant group, claiming responsibility for many bloody attacks against Coalition forces and the administration of President Hamid Karzai\".[9] Its fighting strength was \"sometimes estimated to number in the thousands\". The group signed a peace deal with the Ghani administration in 2016.\r\nFollowing the collapse of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, on 17 August 2021, Hekmatyar met with both Karzai, former President of Afghanistan, and Abdullah Abdullah, Chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation and former Chief Executive, in Doha seeking to form a government. President Ashraf Ghani, having fled the country to either Tajikistan or Uzbekistan, emerged in the UAE and said that he supported such negotiations and was in talks to return to Afghanistan.\r",

Beyond that, there appears to be no bounds to what is sexually permissible. Child rape is explicitly condoned: “It is permissible to have intercourse with the female slave who hasn’t reached puberty, if she is fit for intercourse,” according to a translation by the Middle East Media Research Institute of a pamphlet published on Twitter last December.",

        "Oath Keepers is an American far-right anti-government militia whose members claim to be defending the Constitution of the United States. It encourages its members to disobey orders which they believe would violate the U.S. Constitution. Research on their membership determined that two thirds of the Oath Keepers are former military or law enforcement, and one tenth are active duty military or law enforcement.",
        "Several organizations that monitor U.S. domestic terrorism and hate groups describe the Oath Keepers as a far-right extremist or radical group. In 2015, Mark Pitcavage of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) described the group as \"heavily armed extremists with a conspiratorial and anti-government mindset looking for potential showdowns with the government\". According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the group's leadership has ties to antigovernment, extremist groups and espouses a number of conspiracy and legal theories associated with the sovereign citizen movement and posse comitatus movement, chiefly, that sheriffs are the highest law enforcement authorities in the United States.Former SPLC senior fellow Mark Potok describes the group as a whole as \"really just an anti-government group who believe in a wild set of conspiracy theories\". The FBI describes the Oath Keepers as a \"paramilitary organization\" and a \"large but loosely organized collection of militia who believe that the federal government has been coopted by a shadowy conspiracy that is trying to strip American citizens of their rights.\"",

        "The Ukrainian mafia is a type of criminal organization with origins in Ukraine. Such organizations are regarded as one of the most influential types of organized crime coming out of the former USSR. The most infamous and well known form of Ukrainian organized crime is the so-called Odessa mafia named after the Black Sea port city of Odessa. Odessa is an infamous smugglers' haven and a key hub in post-Soviet global trafficking networks, not the least of which is moving Europe-bound Afghan heroin arriving from the Caucasus.",
        "Ukrainian criminal organizations are involved in a significant number of illegal activities. Although Ukrainian criminal organizations are for the most part independently operating enterprises, they are sometimes connected with Russian mafia organizations, such as the case with Semyon Mogilevich. \r\nIn the United States the Odessa mafia is based in the Brighton Beach district of Brooklyn, New York. It is regarded as the most powerful post-Soviet criminal organization in the US and has since expanded its operations to Miami, Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay area, where it has established connections with local Armenian and Israeli crime figures. It's known for being a very secretive organization and is involved in protection rackets, loan-sharking, murder-for-hire, narcotics trafficking, as well as the infamous fuel tax fraud rackets. Nonetheless a large amount of Odessa mafia-connected gangsters have become part of the US' criminal folklore, examples being Marat Balagula, Evsei Agron and Boris Nayfeld. Feuds, often resulting in extreme violence, happened in the 1980s and 1990s between Odessa gangsters such as the internal war between Balagula and Agron at first, and later on between the Nayfeld brothers and Monya Elson.\r",

Following their return to power in 2021, the Afghanistan government budget has lost 80% of its funding, food insecurity is widespread and Taliban leaders urged the United States and other countries to recognize its régime.

        "Dropil Inc. was a Belize-based company operating out of Fountain Valley, USA. Dropil provided and managed investments in digital assets such as cryptocurrency. Its founders developed  Dropil’s digital asset, called DROP tokens, as well as its digital asset trading program, an automated trading bot called “Dex.”",
        "Dropil's founders induced investors to purchase DROPs by making false claims about the functionality and profitability of Dex, which was said to provide an “expertly managed portfolio balancing algorithm [that] manages risk,” according to information published on Dropil’s website. They held an illegal ICO in 2018 for the sale of DROPs, through Dropil’s website. To induce investors to purchase DROPs, founders made a series of false statements to investors in a “White Paper” published on Dropil’s website and on its Twitter account, promoting the cryptocurrency’s supposed success. In total, the founders obtained approximately $1,896,657 from 2,472 investors through the sale of approximately 629 million DROPs. But they did not use the money as promised to investors and used at least  $1.6 million to fund disbursements to themselves.",

        "Africrypt was a cryptocurrency scam perpetrated by two brothers, Ameer and Raees Cajee. The brothers allegedly targeted high-net worth individuals and celebrities in South Africa, luring them with promises of lucrative returns. They urged their clients to keep the project a secret, which inadvertently lured even more people according to South African authorities.\nCustomers were  unable to access their funds, and the founders at first claimed that Africrypt had been hacked, but cybersecurity experts quickly linked the “hacker's” wallet addresses to the two brothers. The brothers disappeared in early 2022 and have been missing ever since. Reports indicate that they escpaed with around $3.6million worth of Bitcoin.\n",

They watched the price of $SQUID soar from less than $0.02 to a peak of over $2,860 over a short period. The same day as it peaked,  $SQUID was trading at less than a cent after its founders abruptly sold off their holdings and abandoned the project. The founders of the project were estimated to have made over $3 million from the sale of their tokens. At least 40,000 investors that still held the token at the time of the crash were left in the dust in a textbook example of a “pull the rug” scheme.",
