We do not collect any other personal information and take steps to protect the data we collect."

                  Encouraging public participation is crucial to attaining our
                  objectives. We welcome submissions from all interested
                  parties, and we encourage you to do so as well. For your

                  Upon successful verification and acceptance of your submission
                  and the bounty closing, the funds from the bounty will be
                  disbursed to your registered wallet. We recommend reviewing
                  your registered wallet address to ensure the funds are sent to
                  the correct location. You can review your wallet address under{' '}

              a maximum submission limit of ${submissionsPerDay} per bounty per day.`}

            <FAQuestion

              answer="The majority of bounties accept only one submission. Once a submission is approved and the bounty is closed, all remaining submissions are rejected automatically. Additionally, when multiple valid submissions are made for the same bounty, we prioritize the submission that provides a more comprehensive dataset and a superior explanation of the data acquisition process."

            <FAQuestion
              question="Why donate financially to a bounty?"
              answer={
                <p>
                  By increasing the bounty’s monetary value, you are
                  incentivizing more users to work on solving it. Furthermore,
                  some users might not have the needed skill level to solve a
                  bounty but desire to contribute financially to encourage
                  others to solve it.
                  <br />
                  <br /> Consider supporting bounties aimed at targets you
                  believe will serve the public interest. Your contribution will
                  be added to the overall bounty amount and its potential
                  success. Rest assured, the identities of donors will remain
                  confidential.
